# **Voltage Tracker for Oscilloscopes**

My Digital Oscilloscope has a timebase of maximum 50 seconds per DIV and a 12 DIV screen, which gives a mere 10 minutes for following a voltage. Much too fast to track charging or discharging batteries or other slow changing events. An Arduino Mega 2560 with the here introduced shield expands the oscilloscopes tracking time up to 12 hours, or more. As a deposit all necessary settings are displayed on the oscilloscope screen. Of course the shield works on good old analog oscilloscopes as well.
